<!-- 🧠 So, which is better?
- Rolling is great for simple, low-risk updates where rollback isn’t a big concern.
- Blue-Green is ideal when you want zero-downtime + instant rollback.
- Canary is best when you need gradual exposure + real-time monitoring.
If you're just getting started or deploying frequently, Rolling is a solid default. But if you're deploying critical changes or want more control, Canary or Blue-Green might be worth the extra setup. -->

<!-- 🟦 Blue-Green Deployment
Pros:
- Simple to implement.
- Instant rollback by switching traffic back to the old environment.
- Great for minimizing downtime.
Cons:
- Requires double the infrastructure (two full environments).
- Not ideal for gradual exposure or real-time feedback.
🐤 Canary Deployment
Pros:
- Fine-grained control over traffic (e.g., 5%, 25%, 50%).
- Real-time monitoring and rollback based on metrics.
- Ideal for frequent, low-risk releases.
Cons:
- More complex to set up (especially traffic routing).
- Requires robust observability and automation.
So, which is better?
- Choose Blue-Green if you want simplicity and can afford the extra resources.
- Choose Canary if you want progressive delivery, real-time validation, and minimal blast radius.
You can even combine them—start with Blue-Green for staging, then use Canary for production rollout.

That’s a classic DevOps debate, GORLE! Let’s break it down so you can pick the right strategy for your use case.
🔄 Rolling Update
How it works: Gradually replaces old pods with new ones, one at a time (or in batches), ensuring some instances are always available.
Pros:
- No downtime.
- Simple to configure in Kubernetes (strategy: RollingUpdate is the default).
- Doesn’t require duplicate environments.
Cons:
- Harder to roll back—if something breaks mid-deploy, you may already have a mix of versions running.
- No traffic control—users may hit either version during rollout. -->
